# vMixTimer
Let's you start a vMix stream at a given start time and stop the stream after a given duration

This little .NET Console app works with vMix (https://www.vmix.com/) 
to start streaming at a specified time, cut to a video or other input,
and stop streaming after a certain amount of time has elapsed.

You must set your stream settings and get your input ready before
starting.
